Youtube Playlist URL: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_RmvbMK0_fdp0DZHZKm4Q1slAB

In this course, we start from absolute scratch and move up our ways to deep reinforcement learning. 
We do it in multiple parts, and we also apply our knowledge practically by coding our algorithms.


#### Our videos are divided into multiple parts and the code for each part is in a different branch:
- Part 1 and Part 2 have no codes in them
- Part 3 : https://github.com/rajtilakls2510/reinforcement_learning/tree/part_3
- Part 4 : https://github.com/rajtilakls2510/reinforcement_learning/tree/part_4 (Not Uploaded Yet)
- Part 5 : https://github.com/rajtilakls2510/reinforcement_learning/tree/part_5 (Not Uploaded Yet)
- Part 6 : Not created yet

### We solve many reinforcement learning problems and here are some previews of the problems that we solve
